# Tic-Tac-Toe-
Designed and implemented a multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python with a client-server architecture, enabling real-time competitive gameplay. The project utilized Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to modularize game logic, GUI, and networking, ensuring clarity and maintainability. A dynamic GUI built with Tkinter provided real-time feedback on game state, while sockets ensured seamless synchronization between players. Error handling with messagebox enhanced user experience by notifying invalid moves. The system supports multiple rounds, tracks statistics dynamically, and efficiently determines winners, offering an intuitive and engaging interface.
